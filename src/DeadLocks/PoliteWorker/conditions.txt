--Live locks:

Occur when there are multiple threads locked into the task and creates an infinite loop.

--Slipped conditions:

Particular type of race condition where a a task executes erroneously on obsolete information.
(
IE:
    Thread one checks that task1 is OK and not EOF.
    Thread two checks that task1 is OK and is EOF and terminates.
    Thread one tries to act on task but it is not longer valid and creates an error.
)

-- Atomic Action

An action that can't be suspended in the middle of being executed. (all or nothing) (normal actions can be suspended.)

examples of atomic actions:

1. Reading and Writing reference variables.
2. Reading and Writing primitive variables (except long and double because of 2 actions).
3. Reading and writing all variables declared volatile. (still need to synchronize!)
